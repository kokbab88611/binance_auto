# binance_auto
Binance auto futures trade bot which only requires user to set the device time with the servertime.

This bot is still in development process and I highly recommend not using this in real trading yet. 

# How it works
The bot utilises Technical Analysis python library to calculate any indicators and use them as a reference.
Once the bot detects the trading spot, sklearn pattern recognition will make final decision rather to put short or long order.

# Aim
The goal is to achieve 2% proft from *25 leverage futures trading from any kind of crypto currency.
